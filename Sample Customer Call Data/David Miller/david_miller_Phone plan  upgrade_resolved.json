    },

      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "I\u2019ve been going over my limit every month lately."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "I see that. You\u2019re currently on the 10GB plan, and last month you used about 14GB."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Yeah, I work from home more now and use my phone for tethering."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "What\u2019s the price difference?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "It\u2019s an additional $15 per month."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Does it include the same benefits I have now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "Yes, and it also includes hotspot priority and free roaming in Canada and Mexico."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "That sounds good. Any hidden fees I should know about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "No hidden fees. Just the extra $15 monthly charge, prorated for this month."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Okay, and if I want to go back to the lower plan later?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "You can downgrade at any time without penalty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Alright. What about my current contract? Does it extend?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "No change to your contract term. The upgrade is effective immediately."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Alright. Can we also check if there are any promotions running?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "Actually, there\u2019s a loyalty promotion. You qualify for a $10 monthly discount for 12 months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Oh nice. Does that apply to the upgraded plan too?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "Yes, it does. So effectively your increase is just $5 per month."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "That\u2019s acceptable. Please proceed with the upgrade."
    },
    {

      "text": "And can you make sure my autopay picks up the new amount?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "Already updated. Autopay will reflect the correct amount."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "What about my data rollover? Does that change?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "Your unused data still rolls over up to 5GB each month."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Good. And I still get free streaming?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Agent",
      "text": "Yes, streaming benefits remain the same."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Customer",
      "text": "Alright. And I don\u2019t have to sign anything?"
    },
    {
